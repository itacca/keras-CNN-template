# Keras CNN - OOP Classification Pipeline

The project represents an attempt to build modular, OOP approach
for Multi-class classification on images. 

This should be viewed as an introductory Computer Vision (CV) project, 
built around Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture in Keras,
 on top of TensorFlow, version 2.3.

The project provides all abstract OOP core features and abstractions 
that could be used in other tasks as well. Besides this, the MNIST 
classification task is implemented as an example of how to use modular
componentes.
